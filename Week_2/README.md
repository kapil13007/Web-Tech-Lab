# Weather App
A simple web application that fetches and displays real-time weather data for any city. It is built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, utilizing the OpenWeatherMap API. To use, open index.html, enter a city name, and click search to view the temperature, humidity, and wind speed. Remember to insert your personal API key into the app.js file.
